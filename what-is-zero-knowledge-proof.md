In addition to soundness and completeness, PoK protocols can also be designed to have zero- Knowledge, where the prover can convince the verifier of their knowledge without revealing any information beyond the fact that they possess the knowledge.\


Hence [Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/zero-knowledge-proofs) is a subset of PoK that provides an even stronger level of privacy, as the verifier is convinced of the prover's knowledge without gaining any additional information beyond the fact that the prover has the required knowledge. \


Zero-knowledge proofs first appeared in an MIT 1985 [paper](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The\_Knowledge\_Complexity\_Of\_Interactive\_Proof\_Systems.pdf), â€œThe knowledge complexity of interactive proof systems, But it has seen rapid real-world application in recent years. As the popularity of blockchain technology continues to grow, it has become increasingly clear that ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of user data is paramount to the success of many blockchain use cases. Hence  ZKP has gained wide adoption among many blockchain networks.



The technical implementation of PoK and ZKP involves advanced cryptographic techniques such as interactive protocols, commitment schemes, and homomorphic encryption. The efficient execution of these protocols is also a crucial consideration. Various optimization techniques, such as non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (NIZK) and succinct zero-knowledge proofs (SZK), have been developed to reduce computational effort.
