# Use Cases Of ZKP

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have a variety of use cases across industries. They provide a method of proving knowledge without revealing sensitive information, making them ideal for applications that require privacy and security. Here are five common use cases for ZKPs:

#### Anonymous payments:&#x20;

ZKPs can be used for anonymous transactions, which can be valuable in situations where parties want to protect their identities. One example is the cryptocurrency [Zcash](https://z.cash/), which uses ZKPs to shield the details of transactions while still allowing them to be verified.

Another example is the [AZTEC Protocol](https://aztec.network/), which uses ZKPs to enable private transactions on Ethereum. This allows users to transfer ERC20 tokens without revealing the amounts or addresses involved.

#### Decentralized identity and authentication:&#x20;

ZKPs can also be used for decentralized identity and authentication. They allow users to prove their identity without revealing any personally identifiable information. One example is the [Sovrin Network](https://sovrin.org/), which uses ZKPs to enable self-sovereign identity on a public blockchain. [Civic](https://www.civic.com/), which uses ZKPs, provides a more secure and privacy-focused alternative to traditional identity verification methods that rely on centralized databases storing sensitive personal information.

#### Verifiable computation:&#x20;

ZKPs can be used for verifiable computation, where computation is performed on sensitive data without actually revealing the data. One example is Enigma, a decentralized data marketplace that uses ZKPs to allow computations to be performed on encrypted data.

StarkWare uses ZKPs to develop two distinct products: [StarkEx](https://starkware.co/starkex/), which is a permissioned Validity-Rollup that can function on its own, and StarkNet, a permissionless decentralized ZK-Rollup.

#### Highly scalable and secure layer 2s

KPs can be used for highly scalable and secure layer 2 solutions, which are needed for blockchain networks to scale to support large numbers of users. One example is the company [Loopring](https://loopring.org/), which uses ZKPs to enable high-throughput, non-custodial trading on Ethereum.
