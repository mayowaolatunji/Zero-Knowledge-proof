# Limitations of  Zero-Knowledge-Poofs

1. The setup of ZK-SNARKs and ZK-STARKs requires a trusted setup, which means that a group of individuals has to come together to generate and distribute the initial parameters of the system. If the trusted setup is not executed correctly, it can lead to a compromise of the entire system.
2. ZK-SNARKs and ZK-STARKs are computationally intensive and require a lot of processing power to generate and verify the proofs. This can make them impractical for use in certain scenarios.
3. While ZK-SNARKs and ZK-STARKs can prove the validity of a statement in constant time, they have a high overhead cost for small computations, which makes them unsuitable for some use cases.
4. ZK-SNARKs and ZK-STARKs are not completely transparent, as they require a significant amount of specialized knowledge to understand and verify the proofs.
5. Even though ZKPs are designed to operate in a trustless environment, they still require trust in the underlying mathematical assumptions and the integrity of the individuals involved in the setup process.
6. ZK-STARKs are still in the early stages of development, and their scalability has yet to be fully demonstrated.
